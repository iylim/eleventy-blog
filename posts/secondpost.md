### Project Work ~ Flow
Home page has weather, time and recently closed tabs. I worked on connecting the Darksky API. We have the weather showing on the homepage with data from the API. We also created the content for the about me page. We also developed our branding more with fonts and icons. 

### Client visit
Ardash from Symantec came to visit. He was very knowledgeable and passionate about servers and databases.

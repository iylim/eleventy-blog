### Project Work ~ Flow
This week during project work time we researched website design ideas. I set up the server backbone and started implementing weather API using Dark Sky. We wanted to take this sprint to work on planning more than actually starting to code. We wanted to try and implement our main feature of recently closed tabs. We have not really started coding so we do not our velocity. Our biggest challenge with the product is to balance work and leisure and distinguishing the two modes.

### Self Learning
Continued working on Wes Bos Node course. 

### Client Visit
Michael Santiago visited us. He provided helpful feedback on some workplace experiences from a C-suite perspective.
